# tenshpy

I used to use [tenshi](http://www.inversepath.com/tenshi.html) to monitor my linux system logs. The idea behind tenshi is great. Basically you just whitelist every messages that are normal behavior so that as soon as unusual messages appear in your logs, you get an email alert about them.

I decided to port tenshi to python because I was too dumb to install tenshi on fedora. Plus, tenshi is written in perl and I can't read perl.
